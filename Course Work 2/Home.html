  <p>The James Webb Space Telescope is the largest, most powerful space telescope ever built.<!-- even though the text has breaks in it it will remain unbroken on the page it was just for extra clarity-->
  It will allow scientists to look at what our universe was like about 200 million years after
  the Big Bang. The telescope will be able to capture images of some of the first galaxies ever
  formed. It will also be able to observe objects in our solar system from Mars outward, look
  inside dust clouds to see where new stars and planets are forming and examine the atmospheres of
  planets orbiting other stars.</p><!--this is a paragraph-->

  <p>Space telescopes “see” by using mirrors to collect and focus light from distant stars.
  The bigger the mirror, the more details the telescope can see. It’s very difficult to launch a giant, heavy mirror into space. So, engineers gave the Webb telescope 18 smaller mirrors that fit together like a puzzle. The mirrors fold up inside the rocket, then unfold to form one large mirror in orbit.

  Why are the mirrors gold? A thin layer of gold helps the mirrors reflect infrared light!</p>

  <p>Many believe that James E. Webb, who ran the fledgling space agency from February 1961 to October 1968, did more for science than perhaps any other government official and that it is only fitting that the Next Generation Space Telescope would be named after him.
  <p>Webb's record of support for space science would support those views. Although President John Kennedy had committed the nation to landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade, Webb believed that the space program was more than a political race. He believed
    that NASA had to strike a balance between human space flight and science because such a combination would serve as a catalyst for strengthening the nation's universities and aerospace industry.</p>
  <p>As part of an oral history project sponsored by the LBJ Library in Austin, Texas, Webb recalled his conversations with Kennedy and Vice President
    Lyndon Johnson. He was quoted as saying in one transcript, "And so far as I'm concerned, I'm not going to run a program that's just a one-shot program. If you want me to be the administrator, it's going to be a balanced program that does the job for the country..."</p>
